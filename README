# Madras - URL Shortner

Madras is a simple URL shortner written in golang.The URL shortner
is written with the primary aim of exposing me to the language,
the secondary of being fast. 

It will use golang with net/http and lib/pq.

The shortcode -> url mappings are maintained in memory as simple 
golang variables until it crosses the 1M treshold, at which point we
will look into which are the most important ones. 

The steps are as follows for first version. 

1. Get shortcode
2. Render 301 redirect.
3. Use channels to write analytics data.

The creation API is again simple however involves a DB call. 
1. Get the URL
2. Search for the URL in database
3. If found return present shortcode, else create new one. 
4. Show shortcode to user. 

Shortcodes will use a base 50 system with 20 letters in small and
caps and 10 digits. All vowels and the letter s is removed. 

Each shortcode will currently be of 6 characters which gives us 15
billion options. We are looking at interesting things for the 
shorter options like giving people entire prefixes and subdomains 
which can then be personalized. 


P.S: The name is a placeholder, and I choose placeholders from a list
of coffees.
